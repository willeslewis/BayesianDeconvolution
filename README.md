# Bayesian Deconvolution

In this repo I solve the problem of finding the convolution kernel given input and output signals with error. 
I utilize a smoothness prior on the kernel, details of which can be found in the deconv folder under the lnprior function.
Please see the BayesianDeconvolutionExample.ipynb for further details.
